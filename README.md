# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-with-Large-Language-Models.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by connecting them to external data sources. This grounds responses in factual, current information to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy. RAG enables the use of private or domain-specific data, providing up-to-date, trustworthy answers without costly model retraining.
